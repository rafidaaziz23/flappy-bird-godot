# Flappy Bird Clone with Godot Engine

A simple, classic Flappy Bird game clone built from scratch using the Godot Engine and GDScript. This project serves as an excellent introduction to the core concepts of 2D game development.

## üåü About This Project

This repository contains a complete, playable Flappy Bird clone. It was created as a learning exercise to understand the fundamentals of the Godot Engine.

Key features and concepts covered:

- **Player Movement:** Using `CharacterBody2D` for physics-based control.
- **Physics:** Simple gravity and impulse forces.
- **Procedural Generation:** Spawning obstacles (pipes) at random heights using a `Timer`.
- **Collision Detection:** Using `StaticBody2D` for the ground/pipes and detecting collisions.
- **Scene Instancing:** Creating reusable scenes for the player and pipes.
- **Signals:** Using Godot's event system for communication between nodes (e.g., `Timer` timeouts).
